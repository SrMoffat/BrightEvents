# BrightEvents
The Bright Events web-based application is based on a Bootstrap/HTML/CSS front-end powered by a Python-Flask back-end with an intention of making a RESTful API to power the app. The basic application provides a platform for event organizers to create and manage different types of events while making them easily accessible to target markets.
